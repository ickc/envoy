"""Helpers to annotate a nix `brews.nix` list with Homebrew formula descriptions.

This module exposes a single function:

    def add_description(path: Path) -> None

It reads a file containing a bracketed list of double-quoted Homebrew formula
names (e.g. the nix `brews.nix` shown by the user), queries `brew info
<name> --json=v2` for each entry, extracts the description from the JSON
(`formulae[0]["desc"]`) and rewrites the file so that each entry in the list
is represented by two lines:

  - a comment line with two leading spaces and `# DESCRIPTION`
  - a line with two leading spaces and the double-quoted package name

Only the standard library is used; `brew` is invoked via `subprocess`. If `brew`
is not available or fails for an entry, an empty comment is written for that
package's description.

Example input (simplified):
[
  "ansible"
  "mpv"
]

Example output:
[
  # Automate deployment, configuration, and upgrading
  "ansible"
  # A free, open-source, document viewer
  "mpv"
]
